# Faithful Timing Core — Game Plan (psxrecomp)

**READ THIS EACH SESSION.** Referenced from CLAUDE.md Rule -1 and from the
auto-memory ([[psxrecomp-build-faithful-core-not-hacks]],
[[precise_irq_slice_state]]). This is the authoritative plan; update the
"Status / Log" section every session.

---

## 0. North star + guardrails (non-negotiable)

Build the **faithful hardware-timing core** of the static recompiler. The PSX
recompiler is being BUILT, not preserved:

- The correct fix is ALWAYS the faithful, class-level core — NEVER a surgical
  per-game patch, symptom workaround, `game.toml` hack, or "make native agree
  with interp even if both are fake."
- Breaking other titles is acceptable; they were built on a faulty ecosystem and
  will be **regenerated**. Backward-compat is NOT a constraint.
- No stubs, no HLE, no interpreter-as-fallback (Architecture A locked). Fix the
  recompiler/runtime and regenerate; never edit `generated/*.c`.
- Don't guess (PRINCIPLES). Confirm every mechanism with the oracle + rings
  BEFORE changing code. Build observability first.
- Confer with ChatGPT via the **Chrome MCP browser at chatgpt.com** — the
  existing "PSX Static Recompiler Debug" chat (the user has Plus logged in).
  NOT the `codex` CLI (usage-limited).

## 1. The problem (diagnosis, confirmed)

A static recompiler charges cycles **block-granular** (instruction count up front
at each block leader) and checks IRQs at **block edges**. Real HW and the
sanctioned dirty-RAM interpreter have a **per-instruction** cycle timeline and
take IRQs at the exact instruction. Games that read timers / poll IRQ-driven
flags in tight loops fork between backends.

Tomba 2 (SCUS-94454) logo→FMV stall is the canonical case. The cascade:
1. Timer1 debounce value-fork @ pc 0x8008592C (frame 1823) — fixed by exact block
   cycle costs ("Fix A", already in tree).
2. **CURRENT BLOCKER:** measured **−8 cycle drift** (native BEHIND interp),
   entering in the BIOS→overlay init transition (func 0x80050B0C subtree). The
   frame-1824 logo-delay wait loop (caller 0x8008AE48 → RCnt reader 0x80085900;
   exits when *0x80102748[=960] < elapsed Timer1) loops ~1557× in interp (reaches
   FMV) vs ~42× native (stuck on logo).
   **Mechanism (located in code_generator.cpp):** when a branch's delay slot is
   ALSO a block leader (`exit_has_delay && !delay_slot_in_block`, ~line 1243), the
   branch block's `instruction_count` excludes the delay slot; on the TAKEN path
   the delay-slot clone runs but its cycle is charged by neither the branch block
   nor the (unentered) delay-slot block → undercount 1/site. ~8 sites = −8.
3. Interrupt take-point granularity (block-edge vs exact instruction) — the
   "precise IRQ slicing" track. PARKED (default off); it is a later correctness
   upgrade, NOT the FMV blocker. Validated design exists (block-leader
   continuations); see §5.

## 2. The target architecture (what "faithful core" means)

Per ChatGPT (validated) + standard practice:
- ONE shared **per-instruction cycle-cost function** `psx_instr_base_cycles(pc,
  insn)` used by BOTH the dirty-interp and the recompiler. No two approximate
  models.
- Recompiler emits **exact** accumulated cycle charges (collapses to a constant
  per pure-compute block); every dynamically executed instruction charged exactly
  once; delay slots owned by the branch bundle.
- **Segmented charge** before any guest-visible time observation (MMIO read/write
  to timers/GPUSTAT/SPUSTAT/DMA/CD/I_STAT/I_MASK, BIOS/device calls, backedges,
  calls/returns) so native and interp observe devices at the same architectural
  boundary.
- **Timers derived on-demand** from a global guest-cycle counter at read time;
  DMA/CD/GPU/IRQ on **scheduled event deadlines** (not per-cycle ticking) so
  compiled stays fast.
- Invariant: *every execution backend may differ in host implementation, but not
  in guest-visible time.* At same-PC convergence points, native cycle total ==
  interp cycle total.
- pc=0 means ONLY a real guest pc=0 / explicit termination — NEVER "dispatcher
  couldn't re-enter." Fail closed + log on undispatchable PCs.

## 3. Phased plan (each phase: confirm → build → regen → run → measure → screenshot)

- **P1 — Cycle-audit observability.** Add a per-function/at-convergence cycle
  audit: record native vs interp cumulative guest cycles at same-PC points; expose
  via TCP/ring. SUCCESS: reproduces the flat −8 and pinpoints the entering site(s).
- **P2 — Delay-slot cycle ownership (the −8).** Fix in code_generator.cpp: branch
  bundle charges its delay slot; not-taken fallthrough → branch_pc+8 (not the
  delay-slot leader); delay-slot-as-standalone-leader charges itself; no
  double-count on the not-taken path. SUCCESS: audit shows −8 → 0; Tomba 2 reaches
  the intro FMV (screenshot). Likely the FMV unblock.
- **P3 — Shared per-instruction cost function.** Single `psx_instr_base_cycles`
  consumed by both backends; recompiler emits exact accumulated charges with
  MMIO/boundary segmentation. SUCCESS: first-divergence hashes identical past frame
  1824 across a longer run; audit stays 0.
- **P4 — On-demand timers + event deadlines.** Timer1/2/0 computed from global
  cycle counter at read; devices on scheduled deadlines. SUCCESS: no perf
  regression; timing-sensitive paths stable.
- **P5 — Precise take-points (fold in parked work).** Re-enable slicing; emit
  EVERY block leader as a CPS continuation (global dispatch → owning func w/
  cpu->pc; never a new entry; fail-closed on undispatchable). SUCCESS: exact-
  instruction IRQ delivery with bounded (one-block) hand-back.
- **P6 — Regression + faithfulness.** Regen + screenshot-smoke ALL titles (BIOS,
  Tomba 1, MMX6, Ape, Tomba 2); delete Tomba2 `overlay_native_block` (must still
  reach FMV/title); calibrate the shared model against Beetle/psx-spx. Pin bump is
  user-gated.

## 3b. Cycle-cost model SOURCE (no clean-room needed — transcribe + verify)

The HW-intended cycle model is documented AND available as reference source we
already have in-tree (our oracle's own code). Stage-2 = transcribe the NUMBERS
(facts, not GPL-protected expression; also in psx-spx) into OUR shared cost
function, then VERIFY each against Beetle at runtime. Do NOT paste Beetle code
(architecture differs + GPLv2 hygiene); write our own informed by the facts.

Extraction map — `psxrecomp/beetle-psx/mednafen/psx/` (main checkout):
- **CPU base / instruction fetch:** cpu.cpp `ReadInstruction()` (~L534) — icache
  model: `timestamp += 4` cache-disabled (0xA000_0000+), `+3` on cache miss/fill,
  `+1` per fill word, near-0 on hit. For a static recompiler this becomes a
  per-block fetch-cost constant (assume cache-enabled steady state; calibrate).
- **Memory wait-states:** cpu.cpp `ReadMemory()` (~L365) / `WriteMemory()` (~L454)
  — `timestamp += (ReadFudge>>4)&2`, the `lts` delta from `PSX_MemRead*` is the
  region wait-state; `LDAbsorb = lts - timestamp` is the load-delay absorb. Charge
  in OUR psx_read/write path by region (RAM fast, BIOS ROM slow, scratchpad fast,
  MMIO per-device). Split clean from CPU base (don't double-count).
- **Mult/Div latency:** cpu.cpp `MULT_Tab24` (~L101), `muldiv_ts_done` (~L154) —
  mult/div set a completion timestamp; a later MFHI/MFLO stalls until then. Model
  as a documented latency (mult ~6-13 by operand magnitude via MULT_Tab; div/divu
  ~36). Encode as instruction cost + optional stall-on-read.
- **GTE/COP2 per-command cycles:** gte.cpp `GTE_Instruction()` (L1713) returns the
  count via each op fn (DPCS/MVMVA/NCDS/…). Well-known table (also psx-spx):
  RTPS=15 RTPT=23 MVMVA=8 SQR=5 OP=6 AVSZ3=5 AVSZ4=6 NCLIP=8 NCDS=19 NCDT=44
  NCCS=17 NCCT=39 NCS=14 NCT=30 CC=11 CCS? CDP=13 DPCS=8 DPCT=17 DCPL=8 INTPL=8
  GPF=5 GPL=5 (verify each against gte.cpp op-fn returns + psx-spx before use).
- **Timers (already partly faithful):** timer.cpp — divider ratios already used
  (T1 hblank ÷2146 etc.); move to on-demand counter = f(global cycles) at read.

Build order for the model (P3 → Stage-2):
1. Shared header (single source of truth) consumed by interp (runtime) AND
   recompiler (it already includes ../../runtime/include/*.h): identity first
   (cost=1) → regen → prove byte-identical generated cycle charges (zero behaviour
   change) → seam established.
2. Fill real costs from the extraction map, ONE component at a time, each verified
   against Beetle at runtime (native cumulative cycles == Beetle at convergence).
3. Memory wait-states in the psx_read/write path (region table).
DO each transcription with the Beetle source open + a runtime cross-check; a wrong
cycle number CREATES divergence, so verify, don't rush.

## 3c. STAGE 2 — full hardware cycle accuracy (the goal; -8 is DONE/past)

The -8 was backend-disagreement (native vs our interp); FIXED (FMV reached). Stage 2
makes the cycle model match REAL R3000A timing, validated against Beetle. We are NOT
hardware-cycle-accurate yet: model is ~1 cycle/instruction; Beetle charges ~2x.

### The validation breakthrough: DELTA comparison (offset-independent)
Absolute-cycle comparison through boot is meaningless (native is ~121M cycles off
Beetle due to turbo-loads/overlay load-model differences). BUT the cyc_watch
comparator's per-hit DELTAS cancel that offset: between two consecutive hits of the
same anchor (one iteration of identical code), native charged 46 cycles vs Beetle 91
(@0x80017FC4). That ~2x gap IS the cycle-model inaccuracy, measured cleanly. So:
  VALIDATE STAGE 2 BY MATCHING native Δcycles == Beetle Δcycles over identical
  regions (consecutive same-anchor hits, or entry/exit anchor pairs), NOT absolute.
First concrete target: make the 0x80017FC4 inter-hit Δ 46 -> 91 (== Beetle).

### Stage-2 progress log
- #1a data-load cost DONE (2ef47bd): psx_instr_base_cycles +2 per CPU load (LWC2 +1).
  Δ gate @0x80017FC4: native per-iter 46 -> 56 (Beetle 91). FMV still streams (no
  regression). Closed ~10/45. Approximation: no scratchpad-free / region / load-delay
  ABSORB yet — those are refinements (absorb would LOWER native, so it's not the
  remaining 35; the remaining gap is other components below).
- REMAINING ~35 cyc: DISASSEMBLED func_80017FC4 — it is only loads/stores/ALU/branches
  + a countdown delay loop; NO mult/div/GTE/MMIO. So the gap is NOT those, for this fn.
  BUT func_80017FC4 exits via a CPS TAIL-CALL to 0x8001EFFC (no normal return), so the
  single-anchor entry-to-next-entry window SPANS MULTIPLE functions (80017FC4 ->
  8001EFFC -> ... -> re-call). => single-anchor Δ is TOO COARSE for per-component
  attribution; the 56/91 covers code we haven't disassembled.
- TOOLING NEXT (before more cost components): add a TWO-ANCHOR region mode to cyc_watch
  (capture cycles at region START anchor A and END anchor B; report Δ(B−A) per pass) on
  BOTH backends. Then validate the cost model on a KNOWN, fully-disassembled single
  code path (no calls/loops crossing out) — e.g. a leaf function entry→its terminator.
  That gives rigorous per-component attribution instead of an opaque multi-fn window.
  Only then resume adding components (fetch / mult-div-stall / GTE / load-absorb).

### Components to transcribe (from in-tree Beetle + psx-spx; verify each by Δ)
The ~2x gap is dominated by what 1/insn ignores. Implement one at a time, re-measure Δ:
1. **Memory access wait-states (biggest lever).** Real loads/stores cost >1 cycle by
   region (RAM/BIOS-ROM/scratchpad/MMIO). Beetle: cpu.cpp ReadMemory `lts` delta +
   LDAbsorb (load-delay). Charge in the load/store path: interp exec_one's mem ops AND
   the recompiler-emitted cpu->read/write (or a per-load/store charge). Region table.
2. **Instruction fetch / I-cache timing.** Beetle ReadInstruction (+1 hit / +fill on
   miss). For the recompiler, fold a per-block fetch-cost constant.
3. **Mult/Div latency.** Beetle MULT_Tab/muldiv_ts_done: mult ~6-13, div ~36, stall on
   HI/LO read. Encode in psx_instr_base_cycles (+ optional stall-on-read).
4. **GTE/COP2 per-command.** Beetle gte.cpp GTE_Instruction table (RTPS=15, NCDS=19,
   NCDT=44, ...). Encode in psx_instr_base_cycles for COP2 ops.
All land in the single-source psx_instr_base_cycles (opcode costs) + a memory-path
wait-state charger (address-dependent). Both backends consume the same model (seam
already in place). Each component: transcribe -> regen/build -> Δ-compare vs Beetle
on a fixed region -> next.

### Caveats
- Δ-region must be IDENTICAL code on both (a tight loop body, or a pure-compute
  function). Avoid regions that cross turbo-load / overlay / dirty boundaries.
- Relocated BIOS-shell funcs (phys 0x30000-0x5AFFF) dispatch at a different native
  phys — anchor on game-text / BIOS-ROM, or the relocated phys.
- This is a multi-component effort; do it methodically, one validated component at a
  time. The comparator (cyc_watch + cycle_compare.py) is the validation backbone.

## 4. Tooling / oracle
- Runtime TCP port 4500; Beetle oracle 4382. Always-on rings: `event_ring`,
  `wtrace_all` (write trace; `newest=1`). `freeze_check` has slice-trace + cycle
  fields. `PSX_EXIT_HALT=1` halts-and-serves at the pc=0 exit for post-mortem.
- Build runtime: `cmake --build Tomba2Recomp/build-t2 --target psx-runtime`
  (PATH=/c/msys64/mingw64/bin). Recompiler: `cmake --build
  _wt-tomba2/psxrecomp/recompiler/build-t2 --target psxrecomp-game`. Regen:
  `recompiler/build-t2/psxrecomp-game.exe --config game.toml` (rebuild tool first).
- Reference: nocash psx-spx; the dirty-RAM interp is the in-process oracle for
  compiled code; Beetle is the HW oracle.

## 5. Status / Log (update every session)

- **2026-06-27 (interp-path Δ-ruler — INTERP == Beetle EXACT on all 12 components):**
  Closed the last validation gap: the dirty-RAM INTERPRETER is now MEASURED equal to the
  oracle, not just shared-by-construction. New tooling: `PSX_FORCE_INTERP=1` makes
  `dirty_ram_is_dirty` (memory.c) report all RAM above the kernel window dirty, so the
  dispatcher routes clean compiled game text through the dirty-RAM interpreter (the same path
  overlays take) — no emitter/dispatch change. Launch psx-cyctest with the env set; the test
  ROM runs interpreted (dirty_ram_insns → hundreds of millions). measure.py --port 4600
  (interp) vs 4382 (Beetle): ALL 12 loops match EXACTLY (baseline/alu/load/load2/load_use/
  div/div_spaced/mult/gte_rtps/gte_nclip/gte_read_use/ld_div). Commit b0391bc.
  TWO PROCESS LESSONS (cost real time — now in cyctest README): (1) launch psx-cyctest via
  PowerShell Start-Process — a bash '&' launch fails to boot (pc=0); (2) sample cyc_watch /
  freeze_check AT STEADY STATE — an early query (before the BIOS boots to the EXE entry)
  reports dirty_ram_insns=0 / warm-up values. That premature-sampling artifact was the entire
  "dispatch paradox" I chased (the interp engages only after the EXE entry is reached).
  NEXT axis: I-cache fetch (ruler #1 84/77 cold-refill spikes).

- **2026-06-27 (GTE-read + MFC0 + muldiv give-back — IMPLEMENTED + VALIDATED, ruler #2 100%):**
  Closed the last steady-state divergences. KEY METHODOLOGY FINDING (Rule 15): Beetle's
  cyc_watch must be sampled at STEADY STATE — its boot/warm-up window reports the
  no-give-back value, which is why earlier sessions mis-recorded gte_rtps as "+15 EXACT"
  (true steady = +11). Added ruler #2 probes (load_use, gte_read_use, ld_div) to Δ-gate it.
  Shipped: `psx_gte_read` (MFC2/CFC2: stall to gte_ts_done AND arm ld_absorb=stall/
  ld_which_t=rt give-back; MTC2/CTC2 keep stall-only `psx_gte_stall`); MFC0 arms
  ld_absorb=0/ld_which_t=rt (suppresses a following load's fudge); `psx_muldiv_stall` now
  CONSUMES read_absorb during the MFLO/MFHI stall + the muldiv_ts_done-1 off-by-one — all
  transcribed from Beetle cpu.cpp:1332-1341/1723-1736, in both emitters + the interp.
  **All 12 ruler #2 loops == Beetle at steady state** (gte_rtps 18→14, gte_nclip 11→7,
  gte_read_use 19→14, ld_div 45→49 fixed; the 8 CPU-load/alu/div/mult loops held); ruler #1
  delta 0; Tomba 2 FMV plays (no regression). The R3000A load-delay + GTE/muldiv interlock
  is now hardware-faithful across every micro-benchmark. NEXT axis: I-cache fetch (ruler #1
  84/77 cold-refill spikes). Commits on wt/tomba2-load-accuracy (unpushed).

- **2026-06-27 (load ReadFudge/LDAbsorb — IMPLEMENTED + VALIDATED, both rulers exact):**
  Shipped the shared per-instruction R3000A load-delay interlock. New `runtime/include/
  psx_cyc.h`: §1 base + GPR_DEPRES + DO_LDS (`psx_cyc_step`) as static-inline helpers over
  new CPUState fields `read_absorb[33]/read_absorb_which/read_fudge/ld_which_t/ld_absorb`;
  `psx_cyc_load_word/half/byte` + `psx_cyc_lwc2_read` in memory.c do the Beetle ReadMemory
  timing (clear give-back, +2 fudge iff predecessor committed no load, region RAM +3 +
  completion +2/+1 as the LDAbsorb give-back, scratchpad +0). The pure dep/res classifier
  `psx_cyc_dep_res_mask` (transcribed from Beetle per-opcode GPR_DEP/RES) lives in
  psx_instr_cost.h. Wired into the dirty interp + BOTH static emitters (code_generator game,
  full_function_emitter+strict_translator BIOS); loads now route value reads through the
  UNCHARGED psx_read_* (cpu->read_* rewired in main.cpp; the flat +4 charge_main_ram_read is
  gone). **Δ-validated against Beetle:** ruler #2 `load2` +10 → **+11** == Beetle, every other
  component still exact (alu+1/load+5/div+38/mult+15/gte_rtps+15/gte_nclip+8); ruler #1
  [c5c→ca4] 54 → **56** == Beetle steady-state (84/77 spikes = I-cache cold refill, P2). Tomba2
  boots to the intro FMV (screenshot pixels, no regression). Builds clean (tools/BIOS/game/
  runtime/cyctest). FOLLOW-UP (separate commit): GTE-read/MFC0 give-back + muldiv-stall
  give-back consumption (don't affect rulers; needed for mixed-code faithfulness). Supersedes
  the "MODEL NAILED, impl pending" entry below.

- **2026-06-27 (load ReadFudge/LDAbsorb — MODEL NAILED empirically, impl pending):**
  Derived the last load-path component (the residual on both rulers) by measuring
  Beetle's PER-INSTRUCTION cost via adjacent-PC region cyc_watch. Confirmed:
  fudge = +2 iff the previous instruction committed no pending load (ReadFudge=0x20;
  `(reg>>4)&2` is 0 for all real regs), else 0; region+completion=5 (LDAbsorb excludes
  fudge); the load-delay-slot instruction does NOT absorb (its §1 precedes its DO_LDS),
  the instructions after it do. Per-instruction Beetle data: load = lw7/addiu1/bne0/nop0;
  load2 = lw7/lw6/addiu1/bne0/nop0. Full model + implementation spec in
  `accuracy/load_readfudge_ldabsorb.md`. Implementation is pervasive (per-instruction
  ReadAbsorb + GPR_DEP/RES in both emitters + interp) → a focused next task on a clean
  tree; validate via the ruler-loop anchors (baseline 3 / load 8 / load2 14). No code
  changed this step (read-only empirical derivation).

- **2026-06-27 (interp-path cycle ruler — enabler DONE + validated):** The dirty
  interp now emits `debug_server_cyc_observe(pc)` per instruction (gated), so
  interp-executed PCs are cyc_watch-anchorable (were not). Validated: a live
  Tomba2 overlay interp loop (0x8010724C) records stable cyc_watch hits at 38
  cyc/iter, parity with compiled-PC anchoring; FMV no-regression over 150M+
  interp insns. Commit fc85d8b. This lets interp-side cycle work (the muldiv +
  GTE stalls) be MEASURED, not just by-construction. REMAINING for a fully
  isolated single-component interp ruler: the cyctest harness does not route
  indirect jumps to the dirty interp (a jalr to a scratch dirty address left
  dirty_ram_insns=0 there), so a clean dirty-RAM component loop needs cyctest
  interp-dispatch wiring (or an overlay_cache=off Tomba2 component anchor).

- **2026-06-27 (GTE per-command completion-stall — VALIDATED EXACT):** Modeled
  GTE (COP2) command latency + stall-on-COP2-access. New CPUState.gte_ts_done;
  a GTE command arms it (now + cost-1, serializing back-to-back ops); any COP2
  reg access (MFC2/CFC2/MTC2/CTC2/LWC2/SWC2) stalls to it. Cost table
  (psx_cycles.c) transcribed+verified from beetle gte.cpp op returns (note
  AVSZ4=5 not the psx-spx-doc's 6). Set armed in the shared gte_execute (both
  backends); stall emitted at every COP2 reg-access site in both emitters + the
  interp (offset cancels like muldiv). Added gte_rtps/gte_nclip loops to ruler
  #2: native +15/+8 == Beetle +15/+8 EXACT; all other components unchanged;
  Tomba2 boots to FMV no-regression. Commit ec1fd76. Required regen. UNPUSHED.

- **2026-06-27 (dirty-interp mult/div completion-stall — backend parity):**
  Completed the mult/div stall to the SECOND backend. The dirty-RAM interpreter
  (Tomba2 overlays) charged 0 for mult/div while the compiled emitters already
  set `muldiv_ts_done` + stall MFHI/MFLO — an inter-backend cost inconsistency
  that drifts the shared guest-cycle timeline. `dirty_ram_interp.c` now mirrors
  the compiled emitter exactly via the shared helpers (MULT→`psx_mult_latency_s`,
  MULTU→`_u`, DIV/DIVU→37, MFHI/MFLO→`psx_muldiv_stall`), under
  `PSX_ENABLE_BLOCK_CYCLES`. The interp charges base after exec_one (vs compiled
  "+1 at top") but the set/stall offset cancels (verified algebraically). The
  latency VALUES are already oracle-EXACT on rulers #1/#2 (compiled path); this
  makes the interp apply the identical model. Validated: Tomba2 boots to FMV,
  no regression. Caveat: validation is by-construction + no-regression, NOT a
  direct interp Δ — interp emits no cyc_observe and the testrom isn't an overlay,
  so a true interp-path ruler (interp cyc_observe + force-interp routing) is
  future tooling. Commit 75d5d1a, runtime-only, no regen, UNPUSHED.

- **2026-06-27 (load=4 boot wedge RESOLVED — faithful guest-cycle pad ACK):**
  The oracle-accurate load wait-state (=4) had deterministically wedged Tomba 2
  boot in the BIOS shell (handle s1=104 → 1672-stride table index → wild ptr
  0x8013B608 → RAM corruption → pc=0). Step A (confirm, not hypothesise): the
  proximate runaway was **100% controller (pad) polling** — `sio_irq_dump` showed
  the last 150+ SIO IRQs all `source=pad, delay=4, active_device=PAD, mc_state=0`
  (card idle), NOT the memcard enumeration the handoff guessed. Source-confirmed
  unfaithfulness: the pad fast-path (`sio.c:1386`) armed the access-paced
  `sio_irq_countdown=SIO_IRQ_DELAY_PAD(4)`, decremented once **per SIO register
  access** (sio_tick is only ever called cycles=0), so pad ACK→IRQ7 was
  access-count-paced, not guest-cycle-paced; the faster (accurate) CPU fired it at
  the wrong guest-cycle phase vs the cycle-paced timers/VBLANK → BIOS pad-detect
  state machine diverged. Step B (faithful fix): the pad fast-path now arms the
  **guest-cycle-paced ack scheduler** (`sio_pending_ack`/`sio_ack_remaining =
  BAUD+ACK = 1258 cyc`, driven by `sio_advance`←`psx_advance_cycles`), identical
  to the already-faithful card path. RESULT: load=4 boots **past the wedge to the
  intro FMV** (screenshot-verified, frame 11k+ stable). Ruler #1 native 54 vs
  Beetle 56 = the known load-ReadFudge gap on the load=4 branch, NOT a regression
  (SIO timing can't change CPU instruction cost). Runtime-only (`runtime/src/sio.c`),
  no regen, UNCOMMITTED. Write-up: WEDGE_load4_shell_rootcause.md. Follow-up
  (completeness, non-blocking): axis5 Fix-6 / "1.0e-e2" fully removes the pad
  fast-path so pad+card share one shifter path — needs menu input validation.

- **2026-06-27 (BIOS emitter muldiv stall — ruler #1 now EXACT):** Applied
  per-instruction cycle charging + the mult/div completion-stall to the BIOS
  emitter (full_function_emitter.cpp: +1 at the top of every in-function
  instruction + the 4 inlined orphaned-delay-slot sites; block-up-front charge
  off in per-insn mode) and StrictTranslator (MULTU/DIV/DIVU → psx_muldiv_set,
  MFHI/MFLO → psx_muldiv_stall). RESULT: ruler #1 [0x80001C5C→0x80001CA4] native
  30→56 == Beetle 56, STEADY DELTA 0 — EXACT. Both rulers now match the oracle for
  mult/div (ruler #2 game-side already exact). FMV no regression (i_stat 0x8D,
  full frame). Commit 180b821. The +1-at-top convention cancels the divu-set /
  mflo-stall offset identically to the game emitter (both exact). NEXT: I-cache
  fetch (ruler #1 residual = Beetle's 84-on-cold-hit refill spikes vs native flat
  56); then load wait-state calibration (memory.c +6 → ReadFudge model); then GTE.

- **2026-06-27 (RULER #2 closed + mult/div completion-stall VALIDATED EXACT):**
  Built the full cycle micro-benchmark harness (ruler #2) and used it to land the
  biggest Stage-2 component.
  - **ruler #2 = `tools/cycle_testrom/`**: hand-encoded PS-X EXE of single-component
    isolation loops (baseline/alu/load/load2/div/div_spaced/mult), each measured by
    consecutive-anchor Δ = one iteration; baseline subtraction isolates the cost.
    Both backends boot the SAME synthetic disc (mkpsxiso; license region extracted
    from an OWNED disc via dumpsxiso — LOCAL ONLY, gitignored). Beetle loads it via
    --disc; native via a dedicated psx-cyctest runtime target (boots disc, serial
    CYCT-00101 so disc-identity matches). measure.py compares per-component costs.
  - **Beetle ORACLE costs** (the HW targets): baseline 3, alu +1, load +5, load2
    +11 (2nd load +1 = ReadFudge), div +38 (~36 stall), div_spaced +38 (fillers
    ABSORBED), mult +15 (~13 stall).
  - **MULT/DIV completion-stall IMPLEMENTED + VALIDATED EXACT.** MULT/MULTU/DIV/DIVU
    set CPUState.muldiv_ts_done = now+latency (DIV=37; MULT via MULT_Tab24 14/10/7
    on operand magnitude); MFLO/MFHI stall guest cycles to the deadline
    (psx_muldiv_set/stall in psx_cycles.c). Native previously charged ZERO. Required
    PER-INSTRUCTION cycle charging (PSX_CODEGEN_CYCLE_PER_INSN) — now the DEFAULT on
    this audit branch — so the stall absorbs (the running cycle count must be
    accurate mid-block; block-up-front can't). Game emitter emits set/stall at the
    op sites. RESULT vs oracle: div +38==+38, div_spaced +38==+38 (absorb correct),
    mult +15==+15 — ALL EXACT. Tomba 2 still reaches the FMV (no regression).
  - **Load double-count fix** (earlier today): psx_instr_base_cycles reverted to
    pure execute base (loads=1); memory.c owns the data-access wait-state.
  - Commits 9cec60a, 2b5ad88, 47bcfec, a3e8f28 (+ cyc_watch dedupe). NOT pushed.
  NEXT: (1) calibrate memory.c load wait-state (native +7 vs Beetle +5: flat +6 →
  ~4 + a ReadFudge term). (2) Apply per-instruction mode + muldiv stall to the BIOS
  emitter (full_function_emitter.cpp) + dirty interp → closes ruler #1's div-stall
  gap (still 30 vs 56). (3) GTE per-command cycles (same stall mechanism, gte.cpp
  table). (4) I-cache fetch. Each Δ-gated on the rulers, FMV-verified.

- **2026-06-26 (RULER #1 BUILT + load double-count bug found & fixed):** Built the
  game-independent BIOS-kernel cycle ruler the §3c "TOOLING NEXT" called for, and
  it immediately paid off. Details:
  - **New oracle-model doc `CYCLE_MODEL_BEETLE.md`** — transcribed the full R3000A
    cycle model verbatim from in-tree Beetle cpu.cpp (base +1/insn minus load-delay
    absorb; I-cache fetch +0 hit / +4 KSEG1 / +3+refill miss; ReadMemory loads
    scratchpad=0/region-wait+2, posted stores; mult 6-13 / div 36 stall-on-MFHI/LO;
    GTE per-command table). This is the calibration ground truth.
  - **cyc_watch double-fire FIXED** (debug_server.c): observe was called from BOTH
    the dispatcher (trace_dispatch) AND the function prologue (log_call_entry) at the
    same cycle → every dispatched entry double-recorded. Added (phys,cycle) dedupe.
    Real tooling bug (Rule 15); native deltas were corrupted before this.
  - **Per-block-leader cycle observe ADDED** (full_function_emitter.cpp →
    debug_server_cyc_observe, #ifndef PSX_NO_DEBUG_TOOLS so prod = zero overhead).
    Native previously observed only at FUNCTION ENTRIES; now it samples at EVERY
    compiled block leader, matching Beetle's before-every-instruction sample. This
    lets cyc_watch anchor ANY block-leader PC (interior loop tops, prologue exits) →
    a clean KNOWN-instruction region on both backends. Emitted at normalize_address()
    (runtime phys) so relocated-kernel anchors match.
  - **THE RULER:** BIOS kernel EvCB-search fn at guest 0x80001C5C (relocated ROM,
    identical in every PSX title). Region [0x80001C5C→0x80001CA4] (18-insn prologue,
    contains divu+mflo + 2 RAM loads, no MMIO/GTE). Both backends now record it.
  - **BUG FOUND — loads double-counted.** Native [c5c→ca4] = 34, fully decomposed:
    block c5c advance 20 (=14×1 + **2 loads×3**) + block c9c 2 + **memory.c +6×2 = 12**
    = 34. The Stage-2 #1a commit (2ef47bd) made psx_instr_base_cycles return 3 for
    loads (+2 data-access) WHILE memory.c's charge_main_ram_read already charged +6
    per main-RAM read — the load data-access cost was counted TWICE. The opaque
    0x80017FC4 window hid this because the load over-charge masked the entirely-
    unmodeled divu→mflo stall (~30 cyc Beetle, 0 native). **FIX:** reverted
    psx_instr_base_cycles to pure execute base (loads=1), per the header's own stated
    "data access charged separately in the memory path" contract. memory.c is the
    single address-keyed owner (like Beetle's ReadMemory). Regen BIOS+game, rebuild.
  - **RESULT:** native [c5c→ca4] 34→**30** (exact: 16+2+12), dead stable. Beetle 56
    steady (84 cold = I-cache line refill). FMV still streams (i_stat 0x8D, no
    regression). The remaining −26 gap is now HONEST and decomposed: native is
    missing the divu→mflo execute stall, and memory.c's flat +6/load needs Beetle
    calibration. NEXT: isolate those two components — the BIOS prologue combines
    div+loads in one block (leader anchors can't split them), so the principled next
    step is **ruler #2 (HW test ROM, Amidog)** for hand-crafted single-component
    isolation loops (div-only, load-only), per the user's "do both rulers /
    completeness not convenience" directive. Then Δ-gate each EXECUTE-latency
    component (mult/div, GTE) into psx_instr_base_cycles and CALIBRATE memory.c's
    wait-state per region. All on wt/tomba2-cycle-audit, uncommitted.

- **2026-06-26 (measure: Beetle cycle clock BUILT + VALIDATED):** Added absolute
  guest-cycle exposure to the Beetle oracle (MAIN checkout, additive diagnostic):
  beetle-psx/libretro.cpp accumulates per-frame `timestamp` (CPU->Run slice) into
  `beetle_total_guest_cycles` (+ reset on init) with `extern "C"
  beetle_core_get_guest_cycles()`; runtime/src/beetle_debug_server.c h_ping now
  reports `guest_cycles`. Rebuilt beetle static lib + psx-beetle. VALIDATED (Rule
  0): guest_cycles advances ~565,022 cyc/frame = real PSX rate (33.8688MHz/~59.94).
  Beetle needs the .CUE (not raw .bin). FIRST CROSS-CHECK: native psx_cycle_count
  rate = 565,470 cyc/frame vs Beetle 565,022 (within 0.08%) => gross cycle-rate
  parity confirmed; remaining drift is fine per-instruction-path (needs same-PC
  alignment). Main-checkout Beetle edits are UNCOMMITTED (additive; master has
  other prior uncommitted work — leave for user to manage).
  NEXT (aligned comparator): Beetle has get_registers (PC) but NO run-to/step/pause,
  so same-PC cycle comparison needs a "capture guest_cycles when guest reaches PC X"
  hook on BOTH servers (native has run_to_frame/step; Beetle needs a PC-watch). Then
  diff cycles@PC native vs Beetle to see the residual drift, and Stage-2 cost
  transcription verified against it.
- **2026-06-26 (P3 step 1 DONE — single-source cost seam, identity):** Created
  runtime/include/psx_instr_cost.h `psx_instr_base_cycles(insn)` (identity, 1/insn).
  Routed BOTH backends through it: interp (exec_delay_slot, dirty-dispatch loop,
  precise-slice) + recompiler (code_generator.cpp sums it per block + outside
  delay-slot clone, folding into the compile-time block charge). PROVEN behavior-
  preserving: regen byte-identical (full.c + dispatch.c diff = empty) and Tomba 2
  still streams the FMV (i_stat 0x8D). Commit b00b81f. Stage-2 now edits ONLY this
  one function. ACCURACY_BURNDOWN.md added (all-axes burndown; axis-5 peripherals,
  esp. SIO/controller hybrid-pad bug, flagged weakest), 09a5d45.
  NEXT (measure before Stage-2 costs — don't guess): build the native↔Beetle cycle
  comparator. Feasibility CONFIRMED: beetle_debug_server.c (in worktree) already
  exposes beetle_get_frame_count via the beetle glue — add a parallel
  beetle_get_guest_cycles. Sub-steps: (1) find mednafen's running master-cycle
  timestamp in beetle-psx/mednafen/psx (psx.cpp PSX_Update / the CPU
  pscpu_timestamp_t accumulator — note it's slice-relative, must accumulate to an
  absolute guest-cycle count); (2) add a C accessor through beetle_libretro.cpp +
  a `guest_cycles` debug command; (3) rebuild Beetle static lib + psx-beetle
  (slow: `cd beetle-psx && make platform=mingw_x86_64 STATIC_LINKING=1
  HAVE_LIGHTREC=0 -j8`); (4) comparator: native psx_cycle_count (already in
  freeze_check) vs Beetle guest_cycles at same-PC convergence. THEN transcribe
  Stage-2 costs (mult/div, GTE table, mem wait-states) one at a time, each verified
  by this comparator. Native cycle side already exists; Beetle side is the gap.
- **2026-06-26 (holistic cycle-model audit, post-P2):** Audited ALL cycle-charging
  sites for the dominant class (delay-slot undercount) + cost-model consistency:
  - GAME + OVERLAY emitter (code_generator.cpp `translate_basic_block`): FIXED in
    P2 (block_exec_cycles +1 for outside delay-slot clone). Overlay/alias path
    shares translate_basic_block → covered.
  - BIOS emitter (full_function_emitter.cpp): NO undercount — different model. It
    emits delay slots IN-LINE at their real address (charged by the owning block
    via block_cycles count to next leader) and defers the branch via
    psx_taken_/psx_delay_ flags, rather than emitting an uncounted clone. So the
    delay-slot-is-leader case charges correctly. No change needed.
  - INTERP (exec_one callers): charges psx_advance_cycles(1u) per instruction
    (3 sites). 
  => The cost MODEL is "1 cycle/instruction", duplicated in 3 places (interp hard
  1u; game emitter instruction_count; BIOS emitter leader-to-leader count). They
  agree (Stage-1 backend-equivalent) but are NOT a shared function and NOT HW-
  accurate (Stage-2). recompiler CAN include runtime headers (already includes
  ../../runtime/include/ws_backdrop_detect.h) → a shared psx_instr_base_cycles()
  header is feasible for P3.
  NEXT CORRECTNESS STEPS (deliberate, not tail-of-session):
  1. MEASURE FIRST (don't guess HW costs): native exposes psx_cycle_count already;
     build the Beetle half — add additive guest-cycle exposure to the Beetle oracle
     (main checkout beetle_debug_server.c) + a native-vs-Beetle cycle/first-
     divergence harness (find_divergence.py is STALE/DuckStation-era port 4371 —
     replace with a Beetle 4382 comparator). This is the holistic correctness
     instrument; it makes drift visible for ALL code/titles, FMV being one measure.
  2. P3 shared psx_instr_base_cycles() seam (identity first → byte-identical regen
     proof → then Stage-2 real R3000A costs calibrated against the measure).
  3. P6: regress other titles (breaking is OK per Rule -1; just know), delete
     Tomba2 overlay_native_block.
  COMMIT: f9d50d7 on wt/tomba2 (local, not pushed, not merged to master).
- **2026-06-26 (P2 DONE — Tomba 2 reaches the intro FMV):** Implemented the
  delay-slot cycle-ownership fix in code_generator.cpp (translate_basic_block):
  `block_exec_cycles = instruction_count + (exit branch sits AT end_addr with a
  delay slot outside the block ? 1 : 0)` — charges the always-executed delay-slot
  clone that was previously uncounted (the -8 undercount). Applied to BOTH the
  slice budget and the block cycle charge. Regen + build clean. RESULT: native
  progresses past the frame-1824 logo-delay loop; screen animates; i_stat shows
  CDROM+DMA+SIO active; screenshot = the lush jungle intro FMV. The multi-week
  logo stall is GONE via the faithful fix (no hack, overlay_native_block untouched
  for now). Mechanism was structurally confirmed (instruction_count excludes the
  outside delay-slot clone) before the change; end-to-end confirmed by FMV
  screenshot. NEXT: P3 (shared per-instruction cost fn + MMIO segmentation), P6
  validation (delete overlay_native_block; regress other titles), and Stage-2 HW
  cycle calibration vs Beetle/psx-spx (current model is 1 cycle/insn = backend-
  equivalent, NOT yet hardware-accurate). Apply the same delay-slot fix to the
  BIOS emitter (full_function_emitter.cpp) and overlay/alias paths.
- **2026-06-26 (earlier):** Diagnosis corrected (timing-faithfulness, not take-point).
  Directive persisted (CLAUDE.md Rule -1, memory, MEMORY.md banner). Precise
  slicing root-caused (mid-function clean-text resume not dispatchable) + ChatGPT-
  validated fix (all block leaders = CPS continuations) — PARKED default-off;
  `psx_game_is_function_entry` predicate + slice-trace diagnostics + env toggle
  `PSX_PRECISE_SLICE` left in tree (inert). −8 mechanism located in
  code_generator.cpp (delay-slot-is-leader undercount). Tree builds + boots clean.
  NEXT: P1 (cycle-audit) → P2 (delay-slot ownership fix).
