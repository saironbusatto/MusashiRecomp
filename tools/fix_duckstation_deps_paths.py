"""Rewrite stale absolute paths inside duckstation's prebuilt deps.

The windows-x64 prebuilt archive ships with CMake-generated Targets files that
have `_IMPORT_PREFIX` baked in as an absolute path from wherever the archive
was originally extracted. When the project root moves (e.g. psxrecomp-projects
-> psxrecomp), CMake can't find the referenced .lib/.dll files even though
they're there.

This script rewrites `OLD_PREFIX` -> `NEW_PREFIX` in every file under
`duckstation/dep/prebuilt/`. Safe to run repeatedly (no-op after first run).
