# Building psx-beetle on Linux

The psx-beetle oracle builds and runs on Linux with the same wire protocol
as on Windows. Verified 2026-07-02 (Kula World boots to demo gameplay;
ping/screenshot served over the TCP debug protocol).

## beetle-psx checkout

`runtime/src/beetle_libretro.cpp` targets the C++ beetle-psx tree. Upstream
master has since been converted to plain C (`libretro.cpp` -> `libretro.c`,
`PS_CPU` class dropped), which no longer compiles against our integration.
Pin the checkout to the last compatible commit — the same base
`docs/beetle_wtrace_hook.patch` was generated from:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/libretro/beetle-psx-libretro.git beetle-psx
cd beetle-psx
git checkout 5759277b          # "audit pass" — last C++-tree base we target
patch -p1 < ../docs/beetle_wtrace_hook.patch
patch -p1 < ../docs/beetle_sio_trace_hook.patch
```

`beetle_sio_trace_hook.patch` adds `FrontIO::SetSIOTraceCallback` (fires per
completed SIO byte exchange) — an integration hook beetle_libretro.cpp needs
that predated the committed wtrace patch.

## Build

```bash
# Static lib. On unix the artifact is named mednafen_psx_libretro.so but is
# an ar archive (STATIC_LINKING=1); stage it under the name cmake expects.
make platform=unix STATIC_LINKING=1 HAVE_LIGHTREC=0 -j"$(nproc)"
cp mednafen_psx_libretro.so libmednafen_psx.a

cd ../runtime
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPSX_LAUNCHER=OFF -DPSX_DEBUG_TOOLS=ON
ninja -C build psx-beetle

# Headless run (picks the next free port from 4380 if taken; watch stderr)
xvfb-run -a ./runtime/build/psx-beetle ../bios/SCPH1001.BIN --disc <game.cue>
```
