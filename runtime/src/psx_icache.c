/* psx_icache.c — R3000A instruction-cache FETCH cost model (faithful).
 *
 * FAITHFUL_TIMING_PLAN.md axis-2 (I-cache). Transcribed from the in-tree Beetle
 * oracle PS_CPU::ReadInstruction (psxrecomp/beetle-psx/mednafen/psx/cpu.cpp:534-601).
 *
 * The R3000A I-cache is direct-mapped, 4 KB = 1024 words = 256 lines x 4 words
 * (16-byte lines). Beetle models it as ICache[(addr&0xFFC)>>2].TV (the per-word
 * tag+validity); a fetch HITS iff TV == addr (exactly). We mirror only the TV
 * array (we don't need the cached Data — the recompiler/interp already have the
 * instruction; we only charge the FETCH cycle cost and clear the load give-back on
 * a miss, exactly like ReadInstruction).
 *
 * Per fetch:
 *   HIT  (TV == addr): +0, and (crucially) NO load-delay give-back clear.
 *   MISS (TV != addr): clear the pending load give-back (cpu.cpp:542-543), then:
 *     - KSEG1 / cache-disabled (addr >= 0xA0000000): +4, no fill (BIOS ROM case).
 *     - cached (KSEG0/KUSEG): +3, then +1 per word REFILLED from the missing word
 *       to the END of the 4-word line; words before the missing one stay INVALID.
 *       So a miss at word W refills W..3 (cost 3 + (4-W)); a later access to a word
 *       < W in that line misses again. Steady-state hot loops are all hits (+0).
 *
 * Residuals (documented, narrow): the BIU cache-enable bit and the SR cache-isolation
 * bit are not modeled — we treat KSEG0/KUSEG as always cached and KSEG1 as always
 * uncached. This is exact except during the brief pre-cache-enable boot window and
 * inside the cache-flush/isolation routine.
 *
 * State is SHARED by both backends (interp per-instruction; compiled per-cache-line
 * leader) so the cache evolves identically to Beetle for the same fetch stream.
