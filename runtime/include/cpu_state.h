/* ============================================================================
 * Dispatch call contract (Bug D / wild-return family fix)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Generated C continuations mirror the guest call graph: after `jal F`, the C
 * code calls F's C function and then falls into the continuation block.  Real
 * hardware has only one stack; if F's flow goes wild (returns to an address
 * other than the call site's $ra, or with a shifted $sp — e.g. a mid-function
 * entry running an epilogue for a frame it never pushed), the hardware simply
 * keeps executing wherever the guest jumped, and the interrupted caller's
 * code never resumes.  Our C model, by contrast, resumes the suspended C
 * continuation whenever the C call returns — re-executing tails on a moved
 * guest stack (the Bug A/C/D zombie family).
 *
 * The contract: a C continuation may run ONLY if the guest actually arrived
 * at it — i.e. the callee came back with $ra == the call site's return
 * address and $sp == the caller's stack pointer at the call.  When the
 * contract is violated, we begin a "bail" unwind: cpu->pc is set to the
 * guest's true target (the wild jr's destination), g_psx_call_bail is set,
 * and every generated frame returns immediately without running its
 * continuation.  The unwind resolves at the first enclosing call site (or
 * dispatch loop) whose (return address, sp) contract matches the guest's
 * arrival state; if none matches, the outermost dispatch loop clears the
 * flag and tail-dispatches the wild target with a clean host stack.
 *
 * g_psx_call_bail is defined in runtime/src/traps.c.  Overlay DLLs share
 * the runtime's state through pointers wired by overlay_init (the
 * PSX_OVERLAY_DLL_BUILD branch; see overlay_api.h / compile_overlays.py).
