/* ABI version exported by every overlay DLL as `overlay_abi()`.  The loader
 * rejects (and deletes, so autocompile regenerates) any DLL whose version
 * doesn't match — including all pre-versioning DLLs, which lack the export.
 *
 * v2: dispatch call-contract (Bug D family) — DLL call sites carry (ra, sp)
 *     contract checks and share the runtime's bail state via the appended
 *     callback pointers below.
 * v3: widescreen backdrop screenX squash ([widescreen.backdrop] x_sites) —
 *     overlay backdrop handlers now emit psx_ws_backdrop_x() at their screenX
 *     store. This is an EMIT-content change (not a struct-ABI change), but the
 *     version is the cache discriminator: bumping it forces the loader to
 *     reject pre-backdrop DLLs so autocompile regenerates them with the squash.
 *     (The deferred follow-up is to auto-derive this tag from a hash of the
 *     widescreen config + emit headers; until then it's a manual bump.)
 * v4: widescreen backdrop column PRELOAD ([widescreen.cull] auto_backdrop) —
 *     overlay backdrop generators now emit psx_ws_backdrop_value() at the
 *     window START/END finalize, and the callback struct grows a
 *     ws_backdrop_value pointer (appended last). Bumping rejects pre-preload
 *     DLLs (which lack both the emit and a host that supplies the callback). */
/*   v5: psx_syscall callback return type void->int (CPS, RECURSION_BUG.md §25);
 *       overlays compiled under CPS emit `if (psx_syscall(...)) return;`. */
/*   v7: advance_cycles callback added; overlays now built with
 *       PSX_ENABLE_BLOCK_CYCLES and charge the shared host cycle/timer timeline.
 *       Bumping rejects stale DLLs that charged no cycles (Tomba2 Timer1 fork). */
/*   v8: check_interrupts_at callback added so generated native overlay block
 *       checks can provide the real guest resume PC for async RFE recovery.
 *   v9: faithful-timing callbacks (cyc_load, icache_fetch, muldiv, mult_latency,
 *       gte, slice_block) so overlay code built with PSX_ENABLE_BLOCK_CYCLES links
 *       against the runtime's real timing impls (the cycle-accuracy rearchitecture). */

/* Codegen flavor of the recompiled output the overlays + runtime were built
 * against. Overlays are keyed in the cache by guest-bytes CRC, which is
 * flavor-BLIND — the same guest overlay yields the same filename whether it was
 * compiled by the base recompiler or a variant (e.g. widescreen, which emits
 * extra runtime symbols + GTE adjustments). Without a flavor tag a widescreen
 * DLL and a base DLL for the same overlay collide. The flavor is folded into
 * overlay_abi() (high 16 bits) so the loader's existing ABI gate rejects (and
 * regenerates) any DLL whose flavor differs from the running build's, keeping
 * caches separate even in a shared directory.
 *
 * Base/master MUST stay 0 so the tag == PSX_OVERLAY_ABI_VERSION (backward
 * compatible with all existing base-flavor DLLs). A variant build overrides it
 * (e.g. -DPSX_OVERLAY_FLAVOR=1 for widescreen) for BOTH the runtime and
 * compile_overlays.py (its --flavor arg). */

/* Codegen version — bumped whenever the recompiler emits DIFFERENT bytes for the
 * same guest overlay WITHOUT an ABI change (the load-time overlay_abi() gate only
 * catches ABI/flavor changes; a pure-emitter change produces a different DLL the
 * gate would happily accept). The cache is namespaced by this version
 * (gcc/<arch-abi>/cg<N>/), so a build with new codegen writes + reads a FRESH
 * directory and never reuses a stale DLL; old versions coexist on disk (no
 * auto-delete — a user who downgrades still finds their matching cache). Python
 * (compile_overlays.py) parses this same constant from this header, so the two
 * sides can never drift. BUMP THIS when you change code_generator.cpp emit in a
 * way that alters overlay output (e.g. the auto_screen_x widescreen widening).
 *   1: baseline + auto_screen_x render-funnel cull via psx_ws_cull_sltiu.
 *   2: + auto_backdrop far-backdrop column preload via psx_ws_backdrop_value.
 *   3: auto_backdrop switched to camera-tracked window WIDENING
 *      (psx_ws_backdrop_value gains a window_cols arg).
 *   4: continuation-passing (PSX_CPS, RECURSION_BUG.md §25) — overlay funcs
 *      tail-transfer + carry an entry-switch; the loader routes continuations.
 *      Fresh namespace so CPS DLLs never reuse a legacy (unit-model) cg3 DLL. */

 * PSX_OVERLAY_CODEGEN_VER — closing the stale-but-cgN reuse that caused the v0.3.0
 * black screen. The build writes overlay_codegen_hash.h (gitignored) into this
 * dir; a fresh checkout without it falls back to 0 (== old single-cgN behaviour)
 * until the first build. compile_overlays.py reads the same value, so the loader
